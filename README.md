# Build a deep audip classifier with Python and Tensorflow

Working with audio data
1. Convert Audio data to Waveform (numerical representation) using Python
2. Transform waveform to spectrogram, Convolution Neural Network can process spectrogram and classify them
3. Perform sliding window classification > Classifying Capuchin Bird Calls (count the number of specific audio detection within that clip)

Step 1
1. Load Audio Data
